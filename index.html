<p>New York City, being the most populous city in the United States, has a vast and complex transportation system, including one of the largest subway systems in the world and a large fleet of more than 13,000 yellow and green taxis, that have become iconic subjects in photographs and movies.</p>

<p>The subway system digests the lion share of NYC's public transport use, but the 54% of NYC's residents that don't own a car and therefore rely on public transportation still take almost 200 million taxi trips per year!</p>

<h2>
<a id="440-million-taxi-trips" class="anchor" href="#440-million-taxi-trips" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>440 million taxi trips</h2>

<p>Thanks to some FOIL requests, data about these taxi trips has been available to the public since last year, making it a data scientist's dream. We endeavoured to delve into this gold mine using 2.5 years of NYC taxi trip data - around 440 million records - going from January 2013 to June 2015.</p>

<p>The primary objective of this project was to predict the density of taxi pickups throughout New York City as it changes from day to day and hour to hour.</p>

<p>So, given a specific location, date and time, can we  predict the number of pickups in that location to a reasonably high accuracy?</p>

<ol>
<li>
<strong>Taxi companies</strong>: Companies can maximize their utilization by diverting the cabs into the locations during specific times</li>
<li>
<strong>Traffic planning</strong>: Planners can use the model predictions for traffic management on specific day/time/locations. The model can be enhanced in future to incorporate features like weather, holiday etc.</li>
<li>
<strong>Data scientists</strong>: It is interesting for data scientist to see how we have modeled location data in a simple way and yet able to get reasonably good predictions</li>

Data preparation with Apache Spark on a Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cluster</h3>

<ul>
<li>We used AWS to setup a 5-node Spark cluster (each machine had 8 cores, 16 GB RAM), and configured the cluster setup to leverage maximum resources by Spark.</li>
<li>We especially used the cluster to load the 60+ GB of raw data into an Amazon S3 bucket, and to process and prepare the data for input into machine learning algorithms.</li>

<ul>
<li>We had to parse 440 million records and remove dirty records (e.g. nulls, invalid geographical coordinates, etc.)</li>
<li>Feature extraction:

<ul>
<li>Location features: We used geohashing to discretize the location data. This is very important because we were able to adjust the granularity of the precision of the location (different size of rectangles) - and make predictions on these locations.</li>
<li>We also added additional features like cosine &amp; sine on the time and day of the week fields (see our <a href="https://github.com/sdaulton/TaxiPrediction/blob/master/DataPrepAWSSpark.ipynb">notebook</a> for more information in our notebooks)</li>
<li>We grouped the entire dataset by time of the day(binned), day of the week &amp; location (<a href="https://github.com/hkwi/python-geohash">geohash</a>).</li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li>We used two models:

<ul>
<li>Random Forest regression: (<a href="https://github.com/sdaulton/TaxiPrediction/blob/master/Machine%20Learning%20(Random%20Forest).ipynb">notebook</a>)</li>
<li>k-Nearest Neighbors regression: (<a href="https://github.com/sdaulton/TaxiPrediction/blob/master/Machine%20Learning%20(kNN).ipynb">notebook</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The main features we used were

<ul>
<li>Discretized latitude/longitude (derived back from geohashes)</li>
<li>Discretized time - but encoded in 0 to 1</li>
<li>Other features: number of pickups, day of week, etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Random Forest model performed very well with a coefficient of determination (R-squared) on the test data of 0.9505, indicating that variation in the model explains over 95% of the variation in the pickup density distribution.  We attribute this success to:

<ul>
<li>How we modeled the data</li>
<li>The abiltiy of the Random Forest algorithm is able to capture the complexities in the above features</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A taxi company could use this type of prediction for developing long-term policies for improved taxi distribution.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>To make predictions about the future, we separated pre-2015 records from 2015 records, while keeping the data of each specific day of the year seperate</li>
<li>Combined NYC taxi trip data with features extracted from NYC weather data</li>
<li>We trained a Random Forest regressor using pre-2015 data and tested regressor by on the 2015  data(<a href="https://github.com/sdaulton/TaxiPrediction/blob/master/Machine%20Learning%20(Random%20Forest%2C%20train-valid-test).ipynb">notebook</a>)</li>
<li> A taxi company could use this type of prediction on a daily basis to tune their policies based on weather or other factors to maximize coverage on a specific day.
##### Predicted Density Distribution vs. Actual Density Distribution on a Specific Date in the Future

</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: the noise in the data became more apparent when we used this fine temporal granularity, and the prediction accuracy decreased.  We believe this results from the regressor thinking that that no data for a particular location and time means the number of pickups is unknown.  Of course in reality, no records for a particualr location and time means zero pickups at that location and time.  We hypothesize that this misunderstanding leads to the widespread overprediction in areas outside Manhattan.</p>

<h3>
<a id="4-next-steps" class="anchor" href="#4-next-steps" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>4. Next Steps:</h3>

<p>To really make this last model shine we would have to adjust the data preparation, so that we feed information about locations without any pickups to the model as well. Right now our model receives no data about the number of pickups in these locations is and thus thinks that the number of pickups is unknown.  However, the absence of records at some locations means that there were zero rides in that time period.  We believe that training a model with that knowledge would lead to more accurate predictions for the number of pickups on a specific date and time, such asMay 1st at 6am.  </p>
