The above image shows the Actual VS Predicted #pickups at different times during any given Monday

## 1. What we did
1. We analyzed around 2.5 years of NYC taxi trip data - around 440 million records. We used spark to pre-process and cleanse the data, and ran our machine learning models. 
2. We wanted to answer the question : **"Given a specific location, day of the week, and time slot, can we  predict the number of pickups?"**. And **we were able to perform this prediction with a reasonably high accuracy**: our RMSE on test data was 0.9505
